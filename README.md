I discovered <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> just before December 2018 and had a lot of fun (except for the problems that were making me swear a lot...but I guess they were kind of fun too). I eventually went back and did all of the 2017 problems as well.

Two weeks in the 2018 problems, I began to find JavaScript a bit too frustrating so I fell back to Python on Day 14, but that felt like cheating. I would still like to work on a language I don't know as well (my day job is C# and SQL and I am pretty comfortable with Python). I did do a couple of the 2018 puzzles in C for variety.

I feel a little guilty abandoning JavaScript so I went back to it for the 2017 problem set.

For 2019 I did rust, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I think this is a "it's not you, it's me" situation. I just never got to the point with rust where coding in it wasn't agony. It's also not well suited to quick, rapid-prototype style coding that Advent of Code encourages.

For 2020, I'm going to do C# and learn some of newer features of C# 8.0 and 9.0 I haven't paid too much attention to, and maybe dive deeper into LINQ than I have in the past.
