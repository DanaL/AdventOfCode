After two weeks, I began to find JavaScript too frustrating a language. I did Day 14 in Python. I would still like to work on a language I don't know as well (my day job is C# and SQL and I am pretty comfortable with Python). Rust? Kotlin? Or maybe F#

Brushing up/improving my javascript skills by doing the 2018 edition of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.

I'm using node.js as my javascript engine for the problems.
