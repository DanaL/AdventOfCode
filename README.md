I discovered Advent of Code just before December 2018 and had enough fun that I think I'll work back through previous years' puzzles too.

After two weeks, I began to find JavaScript too frustrating a language. I did Day 14 in Python. I would still like to work on a language I don't know as well (my day job is C# and SQL and I am pretty comfortable with Python). 

I feel a little guilty abandoning JavaScript after Day 13 of 2018 so I'll probably do some of the past puzzles in JS.
