All of the puzzle flavour text aside, what we are looking for here is the
largest square sub-matrix (ie., the sum of the elements in the sub-matrix) in a
300x300 matrix. Q1 wanted the largest 3x3 matrix and I just wrote a brute force
loop. Q2 wanted the square sub-matrix with the largest sum.

I knew there had to be a more efficienct way to sovle this beyond brute force
and after a bit of research I found Summed-area Tables
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table). I liked this explanation:

const calc_power_lvl = (serial_num, x , y) => {
    const rack_id = x + 10;
    var pwr_lvl = (rack_id * y + serial_num) * rack_id;
    if (Math.abs(pwr_lvl) < 100)
        return -5;
    else
        return Math.floor((pwr_lvl % 1000) / 100) - 5;
};

/* So what we are doing is this: y, x (y is row, x is column) form the bottom
    right corner of the sub-matrix we are checking and its length/width is size.

    So:
        4  -1   7   0
        3  -2  -4   5
        5   0   0   1
        1  -1  -1   2

    If we want the sum of the 2x2 matrix comprising the bottom right corner,
    we take m[y, x] which is 2. We want to subtract m[y - 2, x], which -1 and
    m[y, x - 2], which is 5, THEN add m[y - 2, x - 2]. Basically, we add
    the two matrix sub-totals comprising the cells we want to ignore. However,
    we've subtracted their intersection twice, so we need to add them back. Ie:

        C   C    A   A
        C   C    A   A
        B   B    0   1
        B   B   -1   2

    The cells marked C are where the cells overlap and were double counted.

    Of course, if we have a situation were we want the 2x2 matrix whose lower
    right corner is 1, 3, we only need to subtract m[y, x - 2] from its total.
